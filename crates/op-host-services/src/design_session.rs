//! half carved out of `op-host-desktop`'s `design_session.rs` (the GUI
//! pumps `pump_commands` / `pump_progress` stay desktop-side).
//!
//! The orchestrator (`op_orchestrator::Orchestrator::run`) is `async`,
//! takes `&mut sink` (the `DocSink` trait — synchronous read + write
//! against `EditorState`), and runs to completion across multiple
//! `apply()` calls during scaffold → subtasks → cleanup. The worker
//! thread owns a `RemoteDocSink` that forwards each `apply(cmd)` over an
//! mpsc channel to the UI thread, which `apply()`s on the real state and
//! replies with an ack carrying a fresh `EditorState` snapshot. The UI
//! drains those requests via the desktop residual's `pump_commands`, and
//! progress deltas via `pump_progress`.
